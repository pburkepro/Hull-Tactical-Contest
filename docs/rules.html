  <h1>Contest Rules</h1>
  <h2>Rules for the Best Prediction Category</h2>

  <p>The problem is to predict S&P500 daily returns and implement a market timing strategy that buys and sells the index automatically based on the prediction model.</p>
  <p>The target variable to be predicted is “R” which is 1 (trading) day forward ERP of the S&P500 adjusted for dividends.</p>
  <p>Participants can use any variables in the data file provided by Hull Tactical as predictors as well as are welcome to invent new innovative variables.</p>
  <p>Participants must pass Qualification Phase to move to Live Competition.</p>
  <p>Qualification Phase starts on January 10 and ends on March 2nd. Official certificates will be awarded for successful completion of the Qualification Phase.</p>
  <p>To pass Qualification Phase, participants should submit their best prediction model (i.e., data sets and codes) for out-of-sample tests by March 2nd. The rules for qualification are <a class="ex1" href="hhttps://ucsb-erp-contest.herokuapp.com/qr">here</a></p>
  <p>Live Competition will begin in early March and end in May.</p>
  <p>Each team starts with (virtual) $10,000.</p>
  <p>Participants should determine their position before each trading day begins. Live scores will be updated on Leaderboard at the end of each trading day.</p>
  <p>The team with a highest balance at the last trading day will be the winner of Best Prediction category.</p>
  <p>No short positions (borrowings) are allowed.</p>
  <p>Prediction models will be made public under a free software license. </p>

  <h2>Rules for the Most Creative category</h2>
  <p>The problem is to come up with a novel analysis of the market timing problem.</p>
  <p>Examples could include an explanation of some market phenomena, an insightful analysis of a strategy, an interesting visualization, discovering nonlinear relationships in the variables, etc.</p>
  <p>A typewritten proposal must be submitted by March 2nd.</p>
  <p>Qualifying teams will be granted directed research course units and should finish their final typewritten reports by May.</p>
  <p>Submitted reports will be carefully read and judged by a panel of experts consisting of UCSB faculty and Hull Tactical professionals.</p>
