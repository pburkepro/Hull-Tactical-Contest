  <h1>About</h1>
  <h2>Here we will have what the contest rules are</h2>

  <p>The problem is to predict S&P500 daily returns and implement a market timing strategy that buys and sells the index automatically based on the prediction model.</p>
  <p>The target variable to be predicted is “R” which is 1 (trading) day forward ERP of the S&P500 adjusted for dividends.</p>
  <p>Participants can use any variables in the data file provided by Hull Tactical as predictors as well as are welcome to invent new innovative variables.</p>
  <p>Participants must pass Qualification Phase to move to Live Competition.</p>
  <p>Qualification Phase starts on January 10 and ends on March 2nd. Official certificates will be awarded for successful completion of the Qualification Phase.</p>
  <p>To pass Qualification Phase, participants should submit their best prediction model (i.e., data sets and codes) for out-of-sample tests by March 2nd.</p>
  <p>Live Competition will begin in early March and end in May.</p>
  <p>Each team starts with (virtual) $10,000.</p>
  <p>Participants should determine their position before each trading day begins. Live scores will be updated on Leaderboard at the end of each trading day.</p>
  <p>The team with a highest balance at the last trading day will be the winner of Best Prediction category.</p>
  <p>No short positions (borrowings) are allowed.</p>
  <p>Prediction models will be made public under a free software license.</p>
