# Hull-Tactical-Contest

Team Name: PESTO

Problem: Predict S&P500 daily returns and implement a market timing strategy that buys and sells the index automatically based on a prediction model

Our Goal: Using a gradient boosting model and long-short term neural network, build a model for predicting the price of the S&P 500 Index, and use this prediction along with our strategy to buy and sell shares
