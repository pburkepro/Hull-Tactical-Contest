# Hull-Tactical-Contest

Team Name: PESTO

Predict S&P500 daily returns and implement a market timing strategy that buys and sells the index automatically based on the prediction model

Our Goal: Using a gradient boosting model and a principal component analysis, create a fast and robust LSTM that will predict the day to day changes
